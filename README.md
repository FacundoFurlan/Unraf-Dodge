## 📖 Lore

_For ages, the Circles ruled geometry._

They multiplied endlessly, tracing perfect paths around the world’s center: a square space—cold, sharp, and still.

The Circles saw the Square as a flaw: too rigid, too angular, unmoved by their endless spin. So they chose to erase it.

One by one, the Circles began to orbit, drawing closer. Ever since, they’ve launched fragments of themselves, trying to erase what doesn’t belong.

**But the Square endures.**

Not because it believes it can win, but because it is the last.  
The last to remember a time when all shapes coexisted.  
The last to hold a spark of forgotten symmetry.

Every second it survives is one more second that change might still be possible.

**And though it knows the end is certain, it would rather fall with edges sharp than ever bend.**
